# Programming-Assignment-2-Algorithmic-Warm-up-Fibonacci-number-
This repository demonstrates two methods to calculate Fibonacci numbers:  A naive recursive approach. An optimized iterative approach using dynamic programming. The project ensures accuracy through rigorous testing and improves efficiency for large inputs. also i used c++ for coding.
